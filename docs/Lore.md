Cyberdruid
Comes from Druidic order
Hub
Clarity of air (smog density) clears up the more anti-smog machines that are activated

Level System
- Roots are tunnel systems to travel between dungeons
- There are (three?) paths
  - Path 1
  - Path 2
  - Path 3
- Each path contains a collection of dungeons, at the end of each dungeon, a small anti-smog machine is activated
    - This both decreases the smog density in the Hub
    - And unlocks that root tunnel path (saves progression through dungeon)
- All paths end at a single boss room
    - The smog machines in each path directly before the boss room are much larger
    - All of the big smog machines need to be activated to unlock the boss room
